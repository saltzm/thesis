Ideas:
   Siri voice thing -> learning algorithm that updates pronunciation
   Learn language from Rosetta Stone --> dumb, this is way too hard
   Artificial neural network distributed across the web
       How to leverage the power of users connected to the internet to create intelligence
   %%BEEN DONE%% Relate users of Spotify using LSA or other similar technique and map them
   compare twitter users and map
       convert everything (followers, tweets, etc.) into a document for a user
   compare images with words?  this would be crazy
   Relationship between recognition and generation
       develop general framework for converting between the two? way too hard?
   comparing ANN's that recognize similar concepts
       relate internal structure of networks --> do they have a common "seed"
