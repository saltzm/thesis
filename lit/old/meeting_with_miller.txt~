Research at UGA:
   What's up with Semantic Web?
   Ramaswamy, Liu seem cool maybe?
   Anyone doing data analytics research? Predictive systems like Google Now?
   
Ideas:
   Siri voice thing -> learning algorithm that updates pronunciation
   Learn language from Rosetta Stone --> dumb, this is way too hard
   Relate users of Spotify using LSA or other similar technique and map them
